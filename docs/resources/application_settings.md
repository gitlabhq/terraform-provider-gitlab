# gitlab_application_settings (Resource)

The `gitlab_application_settings` resource allows to manage the GitLab application settings.

~> This is an **experimental resource**. By nature it doesn't properly fit into how Terraform resources are meant to work.
   Feel free to join the [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/terraform-provider-gitlab/issues/957) if you have any
   ideas or questions regarding this resource.

~> All `gitlab_application_settings` use the same ID `gitlab`.

!> This resource does not implement any destroy logic, it's a no-op at this point.
   It's also not possible to revert to the previous settings.

-> Requires at administrative privileges on GitLab.

**Upstream API**: [GitLab REST API docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/settings.html)

## Example Usage
