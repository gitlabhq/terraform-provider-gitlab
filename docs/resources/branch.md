The `gitlab_branch` resource allows to manage the lifecycle of a repository branch.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a project for the branch to use
resource "gitlab_project" "example" {
  name         = "example"
  description  = "An example project"
  namespace_id = gitlab_group.example.id
}

resource "gitlab_branch" "example" {
  name    = "example"
  ref     = "main"
  project = gitlab_project.example.id
}
```

## Import

Starting in Terraform v1.5.0 you can use an [import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `gitlab_branch`. For example:
```terraform
import {
  to = gitlab_branch.example
  id = "see CLI command below for ID"
}
```

Import using the CLI is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Gitlab branches can be imported with a key composed of `<project_id>:<branch_name>`, e.g.
terraform import gitlab_branch.example "12345:develop"
```
