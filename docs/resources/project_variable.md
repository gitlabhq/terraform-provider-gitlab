# gitlab_project_variable (Resource)

The `gitlab_project_variable` resource allows to manage the lifecycle of a CI/CD variable for a project.

~> **Important:** If your GitLab version is older than 13.4, you may see nondeterministic behavior when updating or deleting gitlab_project_variable resources with non-unique keys, for example if there is another variable with the same key and different environment scope. See [this GitLab issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/9912).

**Upstream API**: [GitLab REST API docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/project_level_variables.html)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitlab_project_variable" "example" {
  project   = "12345"
  key       = "project_variable_key"
  value     = "project_variable_value"
  protected = false
}
```

### Optional

- **environment_scope** (String) The environment_scope of the variable. Defaults to `*`.
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **masked** (Boolean) If set to `true`, the variable will be masked if it would have been written to the logs. Defaults to `false`.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

terraform import gitlab_project_variable.example '12345:project_variable_key:*'
```
