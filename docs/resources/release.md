## Import

Starting in Terraform v1.5.0, you can use an [import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `gitlab_release`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = gitlab_release.example
  id = "see CLI command below for ID"
}
```

Importing using the CLI is supported with the following syntax:

```shell
# Gitlab release link can be imported with a key composed of `<project>:<tag_name>`, e.g.
terraform import gitlab_release.example "12345:test"
```
