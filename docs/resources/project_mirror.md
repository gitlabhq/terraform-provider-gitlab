# gitlab_project_mirror (Resource)

The `gitlab_project_mirror` resource allows to manage the lifecycle of a project mirror.

This is for *pushing* changes to a remote repository. *Pull Mirroring* can be configured using a combination of the
import_url, mirror, and mirror_trigger_builds properties on the gitlab_project resource.

-> **Destroy Behavior** GitLab 14.10 introduced an API endpoint to delete a project mirror.
   Therefore, for GitLab 14.10 and newer the project mirror will be destroyed when the resource is destroyed.
   For older versions, the mirror will be disabled and the resource will be destroyed.

**Upstream API**: [GitLab REST API docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/remote_mirrors.html)

## Example Usage
