# gitlab_project_mirror (Resource)

The `gitlab_project_mirror` resource allows to manage the lifecycle of a project mirror.

This is for *pushing* changes to a remote repository. *Pull Mirroring* can be configured using a combination of the
import_url, mirror, and mirror_trigger_builds properties on the gitlab_project resource.

-> **Warning** By default, the provider sets the `keep_divergent_refs` argument to `True`.
   If you manually set `keep_divergent_refs` to `False`, GitLab mirroring removes branches in the target that aren't in the source.
   This action can result in unexpected branch deletions.

**Upstream API**: [GitLab REST API docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/remote_mirrors/)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitlab_project_mirror" "foo" {
  project = "1"

Starting in Terraform v1.5.0 you can use an [import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `gitlab_project_mirror`. For example:
```terraform
import {
  to = gitlab_project_mirror.example
  id = "see CLI command below for ID"
}
```

Import using the CLI is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# GitLab project mirror can be imported using an id made up of `project_id:mirror_id`, e.g.
terraform import gitlab_project_mirror.foo "12345:1337"
```
