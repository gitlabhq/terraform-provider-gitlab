# gitlab_project_push_rules (Resource)

The `gitlab_project_push_rules` resource manages the lifecycle of push rules on a project.

~> This resource will compete with the `gitlab_project` resource if push rules are also defined as 
   part of that resource, since this resource will take over ownership of the project push rules created for the referenced project.
   It is recommended to define push rules using this resource OR in the `gitlab_project` resource, 
   but not in both as it may result in terraform identifying changes with every "plan" operation.

-> This resource requires a GitLab Enterprise instance with a Premium license to set the push rules on a project.

**Upstream API**: [GitLab API docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/project_push_rules/)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitlab_project_push_rules" "sample" {
  project                       = 42
  author_email_regex            = "@gitlab.com$"
  branch_name_regex             = "(feat|fix)\\/*"
  commit_committer_check        = true
  commit_committer_name_check   = true
  commit_message_negative_regex = "ssh\\:\\/\\/"
  commit_message_regex          = "(feat|fix):.*"
  deny_delete_tag               = false
  file_name_regex               = "(jar|exe)$"
  max_file_size                 = 4
  member_check                  = true
  prevent_secrets               = true
  reject_unsigned_commits       = false
}

## Import

Starting in Terraform v1.5.0, you can use an [import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `gitlab_project_push_rules`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = gitlab_project_push_rules.example
  id = "see CLI command below for ID"
}
```

Importing using the CLI is supported with the following syntax:

```shell
# Gitlab project push rules can be imported with a key composed of `<project_id>`, e.g.
terraform import gitlab_project_push_rules.sample "42"
```
