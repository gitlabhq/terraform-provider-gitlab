# gitlab_group_security_policy_attachment (Resource)

The `gitlab_group_security_policy_attachment` resource allows to attach a security policy project to a group.

**Upstream API**: [GitLab GraphQL API docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/index.html#mutationsecuritypolicyprojectassign)

## Example Usage

```terraform
# This resource can be used to attach a security policy to a pre-existing group
resource "gitlab_group_security_policy_attachment" "foo" {
  group          = 1234
  policy_project = 4567
}


# Or you can use Terraform to create a new project, add a policy to that project,
# then attach that policy project to other groups.
resource "gitlab_project" "my-policy-project" {
  name = "security-policy-project"
}

resource "gitlab_repository_file" "policy-yml" {
  project   = gitlab_project.my-policy-project.id
  file_path = ".gitlab/security-policies/my-policy.yml"
  branch    = "master"
  encoding  = "text"
  content   = <<-EOT
