# gitlab_group_security_policy_attachment (Resource)

The `gitlab_group_security_policy_attachment` resource allows to attach a security policy project to a group.

~> [Policies](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/policies/) are files stored in a policy project as raw YAML, to allow maximum flexibility with support of all kind of policy and all their options. See the examples for how to create a policy project, add a policy, and link it. Use the `gitlab_repository_file` resource to create policies instead of a specific policy resource. This ensures all policy options are immediately via Terraform once released.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# This resource can be used to attach a security policy to a pre-existing group
resource "gitlab_group_security_policy_attachment" "foo" {
  group          = 1234
  policy_project = 4567
}


# Or Terraform can create a new project, add a policy to that project,
# then attach that policy project to other groups.
resource "gitlab_project" "my-policy-project" {
  name = "security-policy-project"
}

resource "gitlab_repository_file" "policy-yml" {
  project   = gitlab_project.my-policy-project.id
  file_path = ".gitlab/security-policies/my-policy.yml"
  branch    = "master"

## Import

Starting in Terraform v1.5.0 you can use an [import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `gitlab_group_security_policy_attachment`. For example:
```terraform
import {
  to = gitlab_group_security_policy_attachment.example
  id = "see CLI command below for ID"
}
```

Import using the CLI is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# GitLab group security policy attachments can be imported using an id made up of `group:policy_project_id` where the policy project ID is the project ID of the policy project, e.g.
terraform import gitlab_group_security_policy_attachment.foo 1:2
```
