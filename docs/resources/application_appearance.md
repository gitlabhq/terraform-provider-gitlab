# gitlab_application_appearance (Resource)

The `gitlab_application_appearance` resource manages the GitLab application appearance.
		
~> This is an **experimental resource**. By nature it doesn't properly fit into how Terraform resources are meant to work.

~> All `gitlab_application_appearance` resources use the same ID `gitlab`.

~> When you destroy the resource, you can control if appearance settings are saved or not. Set `keep_settings_on_destroy` to `true` (default) to save changes to appearance settings. Set `keep_settings_on_destroy` to `false` to reset the appearance to its original values.
The original values are saved in state when you create the resource. You can change the `keep_settings_on_destroy` value before destroying the resource to control this behavior.

-> Requires administrative privileges on GitLab.

## Example Usage

# Example where the resource will not update the appearance on destroy
resource "gitlab_application_appearance" "this" {
  title              = "My GitLab"
  description        = "My GitLab instance"
  header_message     = "This is a header message"
  message_font_color = "#FFFF00"
}

# Example where the resource will revert the appearance to its original values on destroy
resource "gitlab_application_appearance" "this" {
  title                    = "My GitLab"
  keep_settings_on_destroy = false
