## Import

Starting in Terraform v1.5.0, you can use an [import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `gitlab_project_integration_github`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = gitlab_project_integration_github.example
  id = "see CLI command below for ID"
}
```

Importing using the CLI is supported with the following syntax:

```shell
# You can import a gitlab_project_integration_github state using `terraform import <resource> <project_id>`:
terraform import gitlab_project_integration_github.github 1
```
