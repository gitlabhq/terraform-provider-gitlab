# gitlab_project (Resource)

The `gitlab_project` resource allows to manage the lifecycle of a project.

A project can either be created in a group or user namespace.

-> **Default Branch Protection Workaround** Projects are created with default branch protection.
Since this default branch protection is not currently managed via Terraform, to workaround this limitation,
you can remove the default branch protection via the API and create your desired Terraform managed branch protection.
In the `gitlab_project` resource, define a `local-exec` provisioner which invokes
the `/projects/:id/protected_branches/:name` API via curl to delete the branch protection on the default
branch using a `DELETE` request. Then define the desired branch protection using the `gitlab_branch_protection` resource.

**Upstream API**: [GitLab REST API docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/projects.html)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitlab_project" "example" {
  name        = "example"
  description = "My awesome codebase"

  visibility_level = "public"
}

# Project with custom push rules
resource "gitlab_project" "example-two" {
  name = "example-two"

  push_rules {
    author_email_regex     = "@example\\.com$"
    commit_committer_check = true
    member_check           = true
    prevent_secrets        = true
  }
}

# Create a project for a given user (requires admin access)
data "gitlab_user" "peter_parker" {
  username = "peter_parker"
}

resource "gitlab_project" "peters_repo" {
  name         = "peters-repo"
  description  = "This is a description"
  namespace_id = data.gitlab_user.peter_parker.namespace_id
}
```

  In the meantime we recommend against using this attribute and use `gitlab_project_approval_rule` instead.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# You can import a project state using `terraform import <resource> <id>`.  The
# `id` can be whatever the [get single project api][get_single_project] takes for
# its `:id` value, so for example:
terraform import gitlab_project.example richardc/example
```
