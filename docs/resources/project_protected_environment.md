# gitlab_project_protected_environment (Resource)

The `gitlab_project_protected_environment` resource allows to manage the lifecycle of a protected environment in a project.

~> In order to use a user or group in the `deploy_access_levels` configuration,
   you need to make sure that users have access to the project and groups must have this project shared.
   You may use the `gitlab_project_membership` and `gitlab_project_shared_group` resources to achieve this.
   Unfortunately, the GitLab API does not complain about users and groups without access to the project and just ignores those.
   In case this happens you will get perpetual state diffs.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitlab_project_environment" "this" {
  project      = 123
  name         = "example"
  external_url = "www.example.com"
}

# Example with deployment access level
resource "gitlab_project_protected_environment" "example_with_access_level" {
  project     = gitlab_project_environment.this.project
  environment = gitlab_project_environment.this.name

  deploy_access_levels {
    access_level = "developer"
  }
}

# Example with group-based deployment level
resource "gitlab_project_protected_environment" "example_with_group" {
  project     = gitlab_project_environment.this.project
  environment = gitlab_project_environment.this.name

  deploy_access_levels {
    group_id = 456
  }
}

# Example with user-based deployment level
resource "gitlab_project_protected_environment" "example_with_user" {
  project     = gitlab_project_environment.this.project
  environment = gitlab_project_environment.this.name

  deploy_access_levels {
    user_id = 789
  }
}

# Example with multiple deployment access levels
resource "gitlab_project_protected_environment" "example_with_multiple" {
  project     = gitlab_project_environment.this.project
  environment = gitlab_project_environment.this.name

  deploy_access_levels {
    access_level = "developer"
  }

  deploy_access_levels {
    group_id = 456
  }

  deploy_access_levels {
    user_id = 789
  }
}

# Example with access-level based approval rules
resource "gitlab_project_protected_environment" "example_with_multiple" {
  project     = gitlab_project_environment.this.project
  environment = gitlab_project_environment.this.name

  deploy_access_levels {
    access_level = "developer"
  }

  approval_rules = [
    {
      access_level       = "developer"
      required_approvals = 2
    }
  ]
}

# Example with multiple approval rules, using access level, user, and group
resource "gitlab_project_protected_environment" "example_with_multiple" {
  project     = gitlab_project_environment.this.project
  environment = gitlab_project_environment.this.name

  deploy_access_levels {
    access_level = "developer"
  }

  approval_rules = [
    {
      user_id = 789
    },
    {
      access_level       = "developer"
      required_approvals = 2
    },
    {
      group_id = 456
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `environment` (String) The name of the environment.
- `project` (String) The ID or full path of the project which the protected environment is created against.

### Optional

- `approval_rules` (Attributes List) Array of approval rules to deploy, with each described by a hash. Elements in the `approval_rules` should be one of `user_id`, `group_id` or `access_level`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--approval_rules))
- `deploy_access_levels` (Block Set, Deprecated) Array of access levels allowed to deploy, with each described by a hash.  Elements in the `deploy_access_levels` should be one of `user_id`, `group_id` or `access_level`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--deploy_access_levels))
- `deploy_access_levels_attribute` (Attributes Set) Array of access levels allowed to deploy, with each described by a hash.  Elements in the `deploy_access_levels` should be one of `user_id`, `group_id` or `access_level`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--deploy_access_levels_attribute))

### Read-Only

## Import

Starting in Terraform v1.5.0, you can use an [import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `gitlab_project_protected_environment`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = gitlab_project_protected_environment.example
  id = "see CLI command below for ID"
}
```

Importing using the CLI is supported with the following syntax:

```shell
# GitLab protected environments can be imported using an id made up of `projectId:environmentName`, e.g.
terraform import gitlab_project_protected_environment.bar 123:production
```
