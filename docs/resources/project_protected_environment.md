The `gitlab_project_protected_environment` resource allows to manage the lifecycle of a protected environment in a project.

**Upstream API**: [GitLab REST API docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/protected_environments.html)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitlab_project_environment" "this" {
  project      = 123
  name         = "example"
  external_url = "www.example.com"
}

# Example with access level
resource "gitlab_project_protected_environment" "example_with_access_level" {
  project     = gitlab_project_environment.this.project
  environment = gitlab_project_environment.this.name

  deploy_access_levels {
    access_level = "developer"
  }
}

# Example with group
resource "gitlab_project_protected_environment" "example_with_group" {
  project     = gitlab_project_environment.this.project
  environment = gitlab_project_environment.this.name

  deploy_access_levels {
    group_id = 456
  }
}

# Example with user
resource "gitlab_project_protected_environment" "example_with_user" {
  project     = gitlab_project_environment.this.project
  environment = gitlab_project_environment.this.name

  deploy_access_levels {
    user_id = 789
  }
}

# Example with multiple access levels
resource "gitlab_project_protected_environment" "example_with_multiple" {
  project     = gitlab_project_environment.this.project
  environment = gitlab_project_environment.this.name

  deploy_access_levels {
    access_level = "developer"
  }

  deploy_access_levels {
    group_id = 456
