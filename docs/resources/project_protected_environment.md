# gitlab_project_protected_environment (Resource)

The `gitlab_project_protected_environment` resource allows to manage the lifecycle of a protected environment in a project.

~> In order to use a user or group in the `deploy_access_levels` configuration,
   you need to make sure that users have access to the project and groups must have this project shared.
   You may use the `gitlab_project_membership` and `gitlab_project_shared_group` resources to achieve this.
   Unfortunately, the GitLab API does not complain about users and groups without access to the project and just ignores those.
   In case this happens you will get perpetual state diffs.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitlab_project_environment" "this" {
  project      = 123
  name         = "example"
  external_url = "www.example.com"
}

# Example with access level
resource "gitlab_project_protected_environment" "example_with_access_level" {
  project                 = gitlab_project_environment.this.project
  required_approval_count = 1
  environment             = gitlab_project_environment.this.name

  deploy_access_levels {
    access_level = "developer"
  }
}

# Example with group
resource "gitlab_project_protected_environment" "example_with_group" {
  project     = gitlab_project_environment.this.project
  environment = gitlab_project_environment.this.name

  deploy_access_levels {
    group_id = 456
  }
}

# Example with user
resource "gitlab_project_protected_environment" "example_with_user" {
  project     = gitlab_project_environment.this.project
  environment = gitlab_project_environment.this.name

  deploy_access_levels {
    user_id = 789
  }
}

# Example with multiple access levels
resource "gitlab_project_protected_environment" "example_with_multiple" {
  project                 = gitlab_project_environment.this.project
  required_approval_count = 2
  environment             = gitlab_project_environment.this.name

  deploy_access_levels {
    access_level = "developer"
  }

  deploy_access_levels {
    group_id = 456
  }

  deploy_access_levels {
    user_id = 789
  }
}
```
