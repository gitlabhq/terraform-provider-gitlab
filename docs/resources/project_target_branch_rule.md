## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitlab_project" "example" {
  name             = "example project"

  visibility_level = "public"
}

// Basic example
resource "gitlab_project_target_branch_rule" "rule" {

## Schema

### Required

- `project` (String) The ID or URL-encoded path of the project.
- `source_branch_pattern` (String) A pattern matching the branch name for which the merge request should have a default target branch configured.
- `target_branch_name` (String) The name of the branch to which the merge request should be addressed.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this Terraform resource. In the format of `<project>:<target-branch-rule-id>`.

## Import

Starting in Terraform v1.5.0, you can use an [import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `gitlab_project_target_branch_rule`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = gitlab_project_target_branch_rule.example
  id = "see CLI command below for ID"
}
```

Importing using the CLI is supported with the following syntax:

```shell
# A GitLab Project targer branch rule can be imported using a key composed of `<project-id>:<target-branch-rule-id>`, for example:
terraform import gitlab_project_target_branch_rule.example "12345:1"
```
