# gitlab_repository_file (Resource)

The `gitlab_repository_file` resource allows to manage the lifecycle of a file within a repository.

~> **Limitations**: The [GitLab Repository Files API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/repository_files.html) can only create, update or delete a single file at the time.  The API will also [fail with a 400](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/repository_files.html#update-existing-file-in-repository) response status code if the underlying repository is changed while the API tries to make changes.  Therefore, it's recommended to make sure that you execute it with [-parallelism=1](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/commands/apply.html#parallelism-n) and that no other entity than the terraform at hand makes changes to the underlying repository while it's executing.

**Upstream API**: [GitLab REST API docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/repository_files.html)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitlab_group" "this" {
  name        = "example"
  path        = "example"
  description = "An example group"
}
resource "gitlab_project" "this" {
  name                   = "example"
  namespace_id           = gitlab_group.this.id
  initialize_with_readme = true
}
resource "gitlab_repository_file" "this" {
  project        = gitlab_project.this.id
  file_path      = "meow.txt"
  branch         = "main"
  content        = base64encode("Meow goes the cat")
  author_email   = "terraform@example.com"
  author_name    = "Terraform"
  commit_message = "feature: add meow file"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **branch** (String) Name of the branch to which to commit to.
- **commit_message** (String) Commit message.
- **content** (String) base64 encoded file content. No other encoding is currently supported, because of a [GitLab API bug](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342430).
- **file_path** (String) The full path of the file. It must be relative to the root of the project without a leading slash `/`.
- **project** (String) The ID of the project.

### Optional

- **author_email** (String) Email of the commit author.
- **author_name** (String) Name of the commit author.
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **start_branch** (String) Name of the branch to start the new commit from.

### Read-Only

- **encoding** (String) Content encoding.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# A Repository File can be imported using an id made up of `<project-id>:<branch-name>:<file-path>`, e.g.
terraform import gitlab_repository_file.this 1:main:foo/bar.txt
```
