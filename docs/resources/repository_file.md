# gitlab_repository_file (Resource)

The `gitlab_repository_file` resource allows to manage the lifecycle of a file within a repository.

-> **Timeouts** Default timeout for *Create*, *Update* and *Delete* is one minute and can be configured in the `timeouts` block.

-> **Implementation Detail** GitLab is unable to handle concurrent calls to the GitLab repository files API for the same project.
   Therefore, this resource queues every call to the repository files API no matter of the project, which may slow down the terraform
   execution time for some configurations. In addition, retries are performed in case a refresh is required because another application
   changed the repository at the same time.

**Upstream API**: [GitLab REST API docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/repository_files.html)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitlab_group" "this" {
  name        = "example"
  path        = "example"
  description = "An example group"
}
resource "gitlab_project" "this" {
  name                   = "example"
  namespace_id           = gitlab_group.this.id
  initialize_with_readme = true
}
resource "gitlab_repository_file" "this" {
  project        = gitlab_project.this.id
  file_path      = "meow.txt"
  branch         = "main"
  content        = base64encode("Meow goes the cat")
  author_email   = "terraform@example.com"
  author_name    = "Terraform"
  commit_message = "feature: add meow file"
}

resource "gitlab_repository_file" "readme" {
  project   = gitlab_project.this.id
  file_path = "readme.txt"
  branch    = "main"
  // content will be auto base64 encoded
  content        = "Meow goes the cat"
  author_email   = "terraform@example.com"
  author_name    = "Terraform"
  commit_message = "feature: add readme file"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `branch` (String) Name of the branch to which to commit to.
- `commit_message` (String) Commit message.
- `content` (String) File content. If the content is not yet base64 encoded, it will be encoded automatically. No other encoding is currently supported, because of a [GitLab API bug](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342430).
- `file_path` (String) The full path of the file. It must be relative to the root of the project without a leading slash `/`.
- `project` (String) The name or ID of the project.

### Optional

- `author_email` (String) Email of the commit author.
- `author_name` (String) Name of the commit author.
- `execute_filemode` (Boolean) Enables or disables the execute flag on the file. **Note**: requires GitLab 14.10 or newer.
- `start_branch` (String) Name of the branch to start the new commit from.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `blob_id` (String) The blob id.
- `commit_id` (String) The commit id.
- `content_sha256` (String) File content sha256 digest.
- `encoding` (String) The file content encoding.
- `file_name` (String) The filename.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `last_commit_id` (String) The last known commit id.
- `ref` (String) The name of branch, tag or commit.
- `size` (Number) The file size.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String)
- `delete` (String)
- `update` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# A Repository File can be imported using an id made up of `<project-id>:<branch-name>:<file-path>`, e.g.
terraform import gitlab_repository_file.this 1:main:foo/bar.txt
```
