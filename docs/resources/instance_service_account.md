# gitlab_instance_service_account (Resource)

The `gitlab_instance_service_account` resource allows creating a GitLab instance service account.

~> In order for a user to create a user account, they must have admin privileges at the instance level. This makes this feature unavailable on `gitlab.com`

**Upstream API**: [GitLab REST API docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/user_service_accounts/)

## Example Usage

```terraform
# create a service account
resource "gitlab_instance_service_account" "example_sa" {
  name     = "example-name"
  username = "example-username"
  email    = "custom_email@gitlab.example.com"
  timeouts = {
    # service accounts do not delete instantly, but you can set up a timeout on deletion
    delete = "3m"
  }
}

resource "gitlab_personal_access_token" "example_token" {
  user_id    = gitlab_instance_service_account.example_sa.service_account_id
  name       = "Example personal access token for a service account"
  expires_at = "2026-01-01"

  scopes = ["api"]
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `email` (String) The email of the user account. If not set, generates a no-reply email address.
- `name` (String) The name of the user. If not set, uses Service account user.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))
- `username` (String) The username of the user account. If not set, generates a name prepended with service_account_.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this Terraform resource. This matches the service account id.
- `service_account_id` (String) The service account id.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.

## Import

Starting in Terraform v1.5.0 you can use an [import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `gitlab_instance_service_account`. For example:
```terraform
import {
  to = gitlab_instance_service_account.example
  id = "see CLI command below for ID"
}
```

Import using the CLI is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# You can import a group service account using `terraform import <resource> <id>`.  The
# `id` is the id of the service account
terraform import gitlab_instance_service_account.example example
```
