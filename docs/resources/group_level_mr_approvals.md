# gitlab_group_level_mr_approvals (Resource)

The `gitlab_group_level_mr_approvals` resource manages the lifecycle of group merge request approval settings. More than one resource per group will conflict with each other.

~> This is an **experimental resource**. By nature it doesn't properly fit into how Terraform resources are meant to work.

~> If `keep_settings_on_destroy` is set to false, destroying the resource will revert settings to the values that were present when the resource was first created.
You will need to apply the resource with the new setting before destroying the resource.

**Upstream API**: [GitLab REST API docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/merge_request_approval_settings/#group-mr-approval-settings)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitlab_group" "foo" {
  name        = "test_group"
  path        = "test_group"
  description = "An example group"
}

resource "gitlab_group_level_mr_approvals" "foo" {
  group                                              = gitlab_group.foo.id
  allow_author_approval                              = true
  allow_committer_approval                           = true
  allow_overrides_to_approver_list_per_merge_request = true
  retain_approvals_on_push                           = true
  selective_code_owner_removals                      = false
  require_reauthentication_to_approve                = true
}

## Schema

### Required

- `retain_approvals_on_push` (Boolean) Retain approval count on a new push.

## Import

Starting in Terraform v1.5.0, you can use an [import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `gitlab_group_level_mr_approvals`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = gitlab_group_level_mr_approvals.example
  id = "see CLI command below for ID"
}
```

Importing using the CLI is supported with the following syntax:

```shell
# You can import an approval configuration state using `terraform import <resource> <group_id>`.
#
# For example:
terraform import gitlab_group_level_mr_approvals.foo 1234
```
