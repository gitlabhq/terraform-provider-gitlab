# gitlab\_branch\_protection

This resource allows you to protect a specific branch by an access level so that the user with less access level cannot Merge/Push to the branch.

-> The `allowed_to_push`, `allowed_to_merge` and `code_owner_approval_required` arguments require a GitLab Premium account or above.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "gitlab_branch_protection" "BranchProtect" {
  project                      = "12345"
  branch                       = "BranchProtected"
  push_access_level            = "developer"
  merge_access_level           = "developer"
  code_owner_approval_required = true
  allowed_to_push {
    user_id = 5
  }
  allowed_to_push {
    user_id = 521
  }
  allowed_to_merge {
    user_id = 15
  }
  allowed_to_merge {
    user_id = 37
  }
}
```
