# gitlab_branch_protection (Resource)

The `gitlab_branch_protection` resource allows to manage the lifecycle of a protected branch of a repository.

~> **Branch Protection Behavior for the default branch**
   Depending on the GitLab instance, group or project setting the default branch of a project is created automatically by GitLab behind the scenes.
   Due to [some](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/terraform-provider-gitlab/issues/792) [limitations](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/ignore-the-order-of-a-complex-typed-list/42242) in the Terraform Provider SDK and the GitLab API,
   when creating a new project and trying to manage the branch protection setting for its default branch the `gitlab_branch_protection` resource will
   automatically take ownership of the default branch without an explicit import by unprotecting and properly protecting it again.
   Having multiple `gitlab_branch_protection` resources for the same project and default branch will result in them overriding each other - make sure to only have a single one.
   This behavior might change in the future.

~> The `allowed_to_push`, `allowed_to_merge`, `allowed_to_unprotect`, `unprotect_access_level` and `code_owner_approval_required` attributes require a GitLab Enterprise instance.

**Upstream API**: [GitLab REST API docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/protected_branches.html)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitlab_branch_protection" "BranchProtect" {
  project                      = "12345"
  branch                       = "BranchProtected"
  push_access_level            = "developer"
  merge_access_level           = "developer"
  unprotect_access_level       = "developer"
  allow_force_push             = true
  code_owner_approval_required = true
  allowed_to_push {
    user_id = 5
  }
  allowed_to_push {
    user_id = 521
  }
  allowed_to_merge {
    user_id = 15
  }
  allowed_to_merge {
    user_id = 37
  }
  allowed_to_unprotect {
    user_id = 15
  }
  allowed_to_unprotect {
    group_id = 42
  }
}

# Example using dynamic block
resource "gitlab_branch_protection" "main" {
  project                = "12345"
  branch                 = "main"
  push_access_level      = "maintainer"
  merge_access_level     = "maintainer"
  unprotect_access_level = "maintainer"

  dynamic "allowed_to_push" {
    for_each = [50, 55, 60]
    content {
      user_id = allowed_to_push.value
    }
  }
}
```

terraform import gitlab_branch_protection.BranchProtect "12345:main"
```
