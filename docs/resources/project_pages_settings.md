# gitlab_project_pages_settings (Resource)

The `gitlab_project_pages_settings` resource manages project pages settings in GitLab.

~> This is an **experimental resource**. By nature it doesn't properly fit into how Terraform resources are meant to work.

~> When you destroy the resource, you can control if pages settings are saved or not. Set `keep_settings_on_destroy` to `true` (default) to save changes to pages settings. Set `keep_settings_on_destroy` to `false` to reset the pages settings to its original values.
The original values are saved in state when you create the resource. You can change the `keep_settings_on_destroy` value before destroying the resource to control this behavior.

**Upstream API**: [GitLab REST API docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/pages/)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitlab_project" "example" {
  name = "project"
}

# Example where the resource will not reset the settings on destroy
resource "gitlab_project_pages_settings" "this" {
  project                  = gitlab_project.example.id
  is_unique_domain_enabled = true
}

# Example where the resource will reset the settings to their original values on destroy
resource "gitlab_project_pages_settings" "this" {
  project                  = gitlab_project.example.id
  is_unique_domain_enabled = true
  keep_settings_on_destroy = false
}
```

## Import

Starting in Terraform v1.5.0, you can use an [import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `gitlab_project_pages_settings`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = gitlab_project_pages_settings.example
  id = "see CLI command below for ID"
}
```

Importing using the CLI is supported with the following syntax:

```shell
# Gitlab project pages settings can be imported using the project ID, for example:
terraform import gitlab_project_pages_settings.example 12345
```
