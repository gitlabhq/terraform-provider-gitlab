# gitlab_topic (Resource)

The `gitlab_topic` resource allows to manage the lifecycle of topics that are then assignable to projects.

-> Topics are the successors for project tags. Aside from avoiding terminology collisions with Git tags, they are more descriptive and better searchable.

~> Deleting a topic was implemented in GitLab 14.9. For older versions of GitLab set `soft_destroy = true` to empty out a topic instead of deleting it.

**Upstream API**: [GitLab REST API docs for topics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/topics.html)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitlab_topic" "functional_programming" {
  name        = "functional-programming"
  title       = "Functional Programming"
  description = "In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions."
  avatar      = "${path.module}/avatar.png"
  avatar_hash = filesha256("${path.module}/avatar.png")
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The topic's name.

### Optional

- `avatar` (String) A local path to the avatar image to upload. **Note**: not available for imported resources.
- `avatar_hash` (String) The hash of the avatar image. Use `filesha256("path/to/avatar.png")` whenever possible. **Note**: this is used to trigger an update of the avatar. If it's not given, but an avatar is given, the avatar will be updated each time.
- `description` (String) A text describing the topic.
- `soft_destroy` (Boolean, Deprecated) Empty the topics fields instead of deleting it.
- `title` (String) The topic's description. Requires at least GitLab 15.0 for which it's a required argument.

### Read-Only

- `avatar_url` (String) The URL of the avatar image.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# You can import a topic to terraform state using `terraform import <resource> <id>`.
# The `id` must be an integer for the id of the topic you want to import,
# for example:
terraform import gitlab_topic.functional_programming 1
```
