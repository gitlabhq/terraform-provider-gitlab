# gitlab_cluster_agent (Resource)

The `gitlab_cluster_agent` resource allows to manage the lifecycle of a GitLab Agent for Kubernetes.

-> Note that this resource only registers the agent, but doesn't configure it.
   The configuration needs to be manually added as described in
   [the docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/install/index.html#create-an-agent-configuration-file).
   However, a `gitlab_repository_file` resource may be used to achieve that.

-> Requires at least maintainer permissions on the project.

-> Requires at least GitLab 14.10

**Upstream API**: [GitLab REST API docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/cluster_agents.html)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitlab_cluster_agent" "example" {
  project = "12345"
  name    = "agent-1"
}

// Optionally, configure the agent as described in
// https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/install/index.html#create-an-agent-configuration-file
resource "gitlab_repository_file" "example_agent_config" {
  project        = gitlab_cluster_agent.example.project
  branch         = "main" // or use the `default_branch` attribute from a project data source / resource
  file_path      = ".gitlab/agents/${gitlab_cluster_agent.example.name}"
  content        = <<CONTENT
  gitops:
    ...
  CONTENT
  author_email   = "terraform@example.com"
  author_name    = "Terraform"
  commit_message = "feature: add agent config for ${gitlab_cluster_agent.example.name}"
}
