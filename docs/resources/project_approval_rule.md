# gitlab_project_approval_rule (Resource)

The `gitlab_project_approval_rule` resource allows to manage the lifecycle of a project-level approval rule.

-> This resource requires a GitLab Enterprise instance.

~> A project is limited to one "any_approver" rule at a time, any attempt to create a second rule of type "any_approver" will fail. As a result, if 
   an "any_approver" rule is already present on a project at creation time, and that rule requires 0 approvers, the rule will be automatically imported
   to prevent a common error with this resource.

~> Since a project is limited to one "any_approver" rule, attempting to add two "any_approver" rules to the same project in terraform will result in 
   terraform identifying changes with every "plan" operation, and may result in an error during the "apply" operation.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitlab_project_approval_rule" "example-one" {
  project            = 5
  name               = "Example Rule"
  approvals_required = 3
  user_ids           = [50, 500]
  group_ids          = [51]
}

# With Protected Branch IDs
resource "gitlab_branch_protection" "example" {
  project            = 5
  branch             = "release/*"
  push_access_level  = "maintainer"
  merge_access_level = "developer"
}

resource "gitlab_project_approval_rule" "example-two" {
  project              = 5
  name                 = "Example Rule 2"
  approvals_required   = 3
  user_ids             = [50, 500]
  group_ids            = [51]
  protected_branch_ids = [gitlab_branch_protection.example.branch_protection_id]
}

# Example using `data.gitlab_user` and `for` loop
data "gitlab_user" "users" {
  for_each = toset(["user1", "user2", "user3"])

  username = each.value
}

resource "gitlab_project_approval_rule" "example-three" {
  project            = 5
  name               = "Example Rule 3"
  approvals_required = 3
  user_ids           = [for user in data.gitlab_user.users : user.id]
}

# Example using `approval_rule` using `any_approver` as rule type
resource "gitlab_project_approval_rule" "any_approver" {
  project            = 5
  name               = "Any name"
  rule_type          = "any_approver"
  approvals_required = 1
}

# Example using `applies_to_all_protected_branches`
resource "gitlab_project_approval_rule" "example-four" {
  project                           = 5
  name                              = "Example Rule 4"
  approvals_required                = 3
  user_ids                          = [50, 500]
  group_ids                         = [51]
  applies_to_all_protected_branches = true
}
```

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Starting in Terraform v1.5.0 you can use an [import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `gitlab_project_approval_rule`. For example:
```terraform
import {
  to = gitlab_project_approval_rule.example
  id = "see CLI command below for ID"
}
```

Import using the CLI is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# GitLab project approval rules can be imported using a key composed of `<project-id>:<rule-id>`, e.g.
terraform import gitlab_project_approval_rule.example "12345:6"
```
