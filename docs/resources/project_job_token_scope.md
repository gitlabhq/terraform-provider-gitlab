## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitlab_project_job_token_scope" "allowed_single_project" {
  project           = "gitlab-org/gitlab"
  target_project_id = 123
}

# Allow multiple projects
locals {
  allowed_project_ids = [123, 456, 789]
  allowed_group_ids   = [123, 456, 789]
}

data "gitlab_project" "deployment_project" {
  name = "example-project"
}

resource "gitlab_project_job_token_scope" "allowed_project" {
  for_each = toset(local.allowed_project_ids)

  project           = data.gitlab_project.deployment_project.id
  target_project_id = each.key
}

resource "gitlab_project_job_token_scope" "allowed_group" {
  for_each = toset(local.allowed_group_ids)

  project         = data.gitlab_project.deployment_project.id

## Import

Starting in Terraform v1.5.0, you can use an [import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `gitlab_project_job_token_scope`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = gitlab_project_job_token_scope.example
  id = "see CLI command below for ID"
}
```

Importing using the CLI is supported with the following syntax:

```shell
# GitLab project job token scopes can be imported using an id made up of `projectId:type:targetId`, e.g.

# For target_project_id:
terraform import gitlab_project_job_token_scope.bar 123:project:321

# For target_group_id:
terraform import gitlab_project_job_token_scope.bar 123:group:321
```
