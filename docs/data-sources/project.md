# gitlab_project (Data Source)

The `gitlab_project` data source allows details of a project to be retrieved by either its ID or its path with namespace.

**Upstream API**: [GitLab REST API docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/projects/#get-a-single-project)

## Example Usage

```terraform
# To search for a project by ID, pass in the ID value
data "gitlab_project" "example" {
  id = 30
}

# To search for a project based on a path, use `path_with_namespace` instead
data "gitlab_project" "example" {
  path_with_namespace = "foo/bar/baz"
}
```
