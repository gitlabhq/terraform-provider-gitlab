# gitlab\_projects

Provide details about a list of projects in the Gitlab provider. Listing all projects and group projects with [project filtering](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#list-user-projects) or [group project filtering](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/groups.html#list-a-groups-projects) is supported.

> **NOTE**: This data source supports all available filters exposed by the `xanzy/go-gitlab` package, which might not expose all available filters exposed by the Gitlab APIs.  

## Example Usage

### List projects within a group tree

```hcl
data "gitlab_group" "mygroup" {
  full_path = "mygroup"
}

data "gitlab_projects" "group_projects" {
  group_id          = data.gitlab_group.mygroup.id
  order_by          = "name"
  include_subgroups = true
  with_shared       = false
}
```

### List projects using the search syntax

```hcl
data "gitlab_projects" "projects" {
  search              = "postgresql"
  visibility          = "private"
}
```
