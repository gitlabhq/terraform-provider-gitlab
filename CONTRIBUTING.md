# Contributing to GitLab Terraform Provider

Thank you for contributing to this provider! :tada: :heart: :trophy:

Generally we accept any change that adds or changes a Terraform resource that is in line with the [GitLab API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/api_resources.html). It is always best to [open an issue](https://github.com/gitlabhq/terraform-provider-gitlab/issues/new/choose) before starting on a change.

## Getting Started

Use HashiCorp's [Plugin Development](https://www.terraform.io/plugin) guide as a reference, especially the [Provider Design Principles](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/hashicorp-provider-design-principles).

See the [Developing The Provider](#developing-the-provider) section below for specifics about this GitLab provider.

## Before Committing

Run `make reviewable` and include any generated files in your commit. This will help ensure your PR passes automated checks.

### PR Checklist

<!--
These are the most common issues in PRs which we have not automated.
-->

For a smooth review process, please run through this checklist before submitting a PR.

1. Resource attributes match 1:1 the names and structure of the API resource in the [GitLab API documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/api_resources.html).
1. [Examples](/examples) are updated with:
   1. A \*.tf file for the resource/s with at least one usage example
   1. A \*.sh file for the resource/s with an import example (if applicable)
1. New resources have at minimum a basic test with three steps:
   1. Create the resource
   1. Update the attributes
   1. Import the resource
1. No new `//lintignore` comments that came from copied code. Linter rules are meant to be enforced on new code.

## Guidelines

<!--
These guidelines are specific callouts for issues that come up occasionally but are somewhat niche.
-->

#### Resource ID and Import

Terraform resources have a unique ID (`d.SetId("")`). The ID should be comprised from the URL path variables of the `GET` API for the resource in the [GitLab API documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/api_resources.html), separated by `:`.

For example, a resource for the `GET /projects/:id/environments/:environment_id` API would have the ID `123:456` where `123` is the project ID and `456` is the environment ID.

This makes it very easy to add import functionality, by using

```go
Importer: &schema.ResourceImporter{
    StateContext: schema.ImportStatePassthroughContext,
},
```

See the [importer state function docs](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/sdkv2/resources/import#importer-state-function) for more details.

#### Documentation

Documentation in [/docs](/docs) is auto-generated by [terraform-plugin-docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs) based on code descriptions and [examples](/examples). Generation runs during `make reviewable`. You can use the [Terraform doc preview tool](https://registry.terraform.io/tools/doc-preview) if you would like to preview the generated documentation.

## Developing The Provider

### Set Up Your Local Environment

You'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.16+ is *required*).

1. Clone the git repository.

   ```sh
   $ git clone git@github.com:gitlabhq/terraform-provider-gitlab
   $ cd terraform-provider-gitlab
   ```

2. Build the provider with `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

   ```sh
   $ make build
   ```


### Use a Remote Environment via GitPod

You can choose to use your own development environment if desired, however a `.gitpod.yml` file is included within the repository to allow the use of [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) easily.
This will allow you to use GitPod's integration with GitHub to quickly start a web-based development environment including Go and Docker, which are necessary
for running tests. To use GitPod's integration, you have two different options described below. After you've completed one of the two options, your development environment
will be ready within a minute or two. As part of starting up, your development environment will automatically start up the `gitlab-ce` container necessary for running
tests, as described in the "Running Tests/Option 1" section below.

#### Option 1: Manually navigate to GitPod

You can manually sign in and open your workspace within GitPod by following these steps:

1. Navigate to [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/)
1. Click [Login](https://gitpod.io/login/) if you have an account, or [Sign Up](https://www.gitpod.io/#get-started) if you do not.
1. Click on "Continue with GitHub" and authorize GitPod to access your account.
1. After you've signed in, select "Projects" along the top menu, click on your forked `terraform-provider-gitlab` project
1. Hover over either the main branch for your fork or the branch you created for your fork, and click "New Workspace"

#### Option 2: Open your GitPod Workspace directly via URL

1. Navigate to your fork of the `terraform-provider-gitlab` project in GitHub
1. Select the branch you want to develop
1. Add `https://gitpod.io/#` to the front of your URL

Your workspace will automatically open the repository and branch that you selected in GitHub.

### Running Tests

The acceptance tests can run against a Gitlab instance where you have a token with administrator permissions (likely not gitlab.com).

#### Option 1: Run tests against a local Gitlab container with docker-compose

This option is the easiest and requires [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.13+) to be installed on your machine.

Note that the you need an up-to-date version of GNU make and an up-to-date version of openssl / libressl.

1. Start the Gitlab container. It will take about 5 minutes for the container to become healthy.

  ```sh
  $ make testacc-up
  ```

2. Run the acceptance tests. The full suite takes 10-20 minutes to run.

  ```sh
  $ make testacc
  ```

3. Stop the Gitlab container.

  ```sh
  $ make testacc-down
  ```

#### Option 2: Run tests against your own Gitlab instance

If you have your own hosted Gitlab instance, you can run the tests against it directly.

```sh
$ make testacc GITLAB_TOKEN=example123 GITLAB_BASE_URL=https://example.com/api/v4
```

`GITLAB_TOKEN` must be a valid token for an account with admin privileges.

#### Testing Tips

* **Gitlab Community Edition and Gitlab Enterprise Edition:**

  This module supports both Gitlab CE and Gitlab EE. We run tests on Gitlab EE,
  but can't run them on pull requests from forks.

  Features that only work on one flavour can use the following helpers as
  SkipFunc: `isRunningInEE` and `isRunningInCE`. You can see an example of this
  for [gitlab_project_level_mr_approvals](internal/provider/resource_gitlab_project_level_mr_approvals_test.go)
  tests.

* **Run EE tests:**

  If you have a `Gitlab-license.txt` you can run Gitlab EE, which will enable the full suite of tests:

  ```sh
  $ make testacc-up SERVICE=gitlab-ee
  ```

* **Run a single test:**

  You can pass a pattern to the `RUN` variable to run a reduced number of tests. For example:

  ```sh
  $ make testacc RUN=TestAccGitlabGroup
  ```

   ...will run all tests for the `gitlab_group` resource.

* **Debug a test in an IDE:**

  First start the Gitlab container with `make testacc-up`.
  Then run the desired Go test as you would normally from your IDE, but configure your run configuration to set these environment variables:

  ```
  GITLAB_TOKEN=ACCTEST1234567890123
  GITLAB_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v4
  TF_ACC=1
  ```

* **Useful HashiCorp documentation:**

  Refer to [HashiCorp's testing guide](https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/testing/index.html)
  and [HashiCorp's testing best practices](https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/best-practices/testing.html).
